# login-page
Simple login website using React, Redux toolkit and tailwind CSS. 

## Demo 

### Description
I am learning react.js and also redux toolkit so made a simple project with them :
suppose that as a register page that can u enter your name and mail ( check validation ) then when you hit enter 
or submit it send request by axios to backend api and if success it save the data in the global ( i mean redux store )
then i use that data in header and sidebar using useSelector 

### Backend 
I used node.js , express , cors and nodemon 
it's very simple api to can host api of users at local host 

### How to use ? 
1) download repo or clone it , hint : plz delete file of package.lock.json and then npm install to can download all required files
2) open file node-api then in any terminal or git-bash write: npm run deploy , it will run at "http://localhost:5000/api/users"
3) now open Login Web then open any terminal or vs code write: npm start
